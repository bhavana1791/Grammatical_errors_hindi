    abstract = "Automated grammatical error correction has been explored as an important research problem within NLP, with the majority of the work being done on English and similar resource-rich languages. Grammar correction using neural networks is a data-heavy task, with the recent state of the art models requiring datasets with millions of annotated sentences for proper training. It is difficult to find such resources for Indic languages due to their relative lack of digitized content and complex morphology, compared to English. We address this problem by generating a large corpus of artificial inflectional errors for training GEC models. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of models trained on this dataset, we create a corpus of real Hindi errors extracted from Wikipedia edits. Analyzing this dataset with a modified version of the ERRANT error annotation toolkit, we find that inflectional errors are very common in this language. Finally, we produce the initial baseline results using state of the art methods developed for English.",
